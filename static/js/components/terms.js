                By accessing and using the Platform, you represent that you
                understand the inherent risks associated with using
                cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a
                working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets
                such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens
                such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20).
                You further understand that the markets for these digital assets
                are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited
                to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation.
                You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with
                cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are
                variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further
                acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or
                all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol. If
                you borrow digital assets from the Protocol, you will have to
                supply digital assets of your own as collateral. If your
                collateral declines in value such that it is no longer
                sufficient to secure the amount that you borrowed, others may
                interact with the Protocol to seize your collateral in a
                liquidation event. You further acknowledge that we are not
                responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or
                control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any
                resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using
                the Platform. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume
                full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using
                the Platform and interacting with the Protocol.

                of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of
                the Platform; (c) unauthorized access or use of any secure
                server or database in our control, or the use of any information
                or data stored therein; (d) interruption or cessation of
                function related to the Platform; (e) bugs, viruses, trojan
                horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the
                Platform; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred
                as a result of the use of, any content made available through
                the Platform; and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal
                conduct of any third party. Under no circumstances shall we or
                any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents,
                affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims,
                proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs
                in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for
                access to and use of the Platform, or .00, whichever is greater.
                This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the
                alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
                liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised
                of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not
                allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or
                exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some
                of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in these Terms may
                not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to
                the fullest extent permitted by law.

              <p className="text-sm text-color pt-2 pr-12 pl-10">
                We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes
                through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential
                dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
                [contact@nordfinance.io] so that we can attempt to resolve it
                without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren’t
                able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your
                email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential
                dispute according to the process set forth below.

                Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the
                Platform, these Terms, or any other acts or omissions for which
                you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited
                to) any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (“Dispute”),
                shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under
                the Arbitration Rules of the British Virgin Islands
                International Arbitration Centre. You understand that you are
                required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The
                arbitration shall be held on a confidential basis before a
                single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to said
                Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in the British
                Virgin Islands, unless you and we both agree to hold it
                elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any
                judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
                in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                agree that the Platform shall be deemed to be based solely in
                the British Virgin Islands, and that although the Platform may
                be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not
                give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any
                forum outside the British Virgin Islands.
